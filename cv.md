## **A little bit about me**

I have had the desire to design and build mechanisms since I was a child. I always found time to repair home appliances and devices. I had a keen interest in electrical engineering and mechanics. As a result of this affection for the business, I was educated as an engineer. Because the fields of engineering are vast and very interconnected, I became interested in programming, which gives me the motivation, drive and ambition to comprehend new and interesting things.
